We apologise for not being able to provide an accurate estimate of waiting time for patients in general. Please be patient while waiting for consultation.\n\nWaiting time display is capped at 8 hours amid a large number of patients waiting for a long time are being treated in the A&E Department. Patients with minor illnesses can consider seeking alternative medical services from private clinics (as listed in {{tapPCD(Primary Care Directory)}} or {{tapHKD(Hong Kong Doctors Homepage)}}).",
