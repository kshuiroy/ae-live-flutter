# A&E Live (急症室現場)

This application provides the waiting time of Accident & Emergency service in all public hospitals in Hong Kong.

## 注意事項 Caution

急症室會優先診治被分流為危殆、危急和緊急的病人。

下列數據是統計過去數小時其他病人的最長等候時間，只供參考，並非現時預計等候時間。

急症室須處理突發意外傷者及危重病人，因此未能準確提供預計等候時間，敬請見諒及耐心等候。

病況輕微的病人可考慮使用私營醫療服務（[基層醫療指南](https://apps.pcdirectory.gov.hk/public/tc)或[香港醫生網](https://www.thkma.org/doctor.php)）。

---

Priority will be accorded to patients triaged as critical, emergency and urgent.

The following data is collated from the waiting time of other patients in the past few hours. This is for reference only but not the current estimated waiting time.

A&E Departments need to manage sudden arrival of accident victims and severely-ill patients. We apologise for not being able to provide an accurate estimate of waiting time. Please be patient while waiting for consultation.

Patients with minor illnesses can consider seeking alternative medical services from private clinics (as listed in [Primary Care Directory](https://apps.pcdirectory.gov.hk/public/en) or [Hong Kong Doctors Homepage](https://www.thkma.org/doctor.php)).
